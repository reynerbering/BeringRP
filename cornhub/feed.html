		<p>It’s getting close to THAT time of year…the true validation that summertime has arrived… Yes, we are talking sweet corn season!  And My Dad’s Sweet Corn has you covered.<br><br>

		It hasn’t been easy, in fact it’s been nearly the TOUGHEST spring to date.  But here’s the deal, Dad is TOUGH too, and he’s doing everything in his power to get his delicious crop to you ASAP.<br><br>

		We so appreciate YOU, our supporters, and we want to keep you in the loop as to when you will see us at the markets.  It’s very hard to predict “go time”, as it truly is a moving target. Right now, we plan to open our season on Saturday, July 1st at select markets and then full force the following week.<br><br>
